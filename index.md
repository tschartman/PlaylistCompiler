## QuickMix App Support

Contact Tim Schartman <tschartman@yahoo.com> for inquiries about the current state of the app.

### Usage

Using the app is pretty simple. Sign into spotify and you can see all of your current playlists. Select up to 5 songs from any of your playlist and click the button to have a new playlist generated that is based on the songs you had selected. You can then export that playlist to your spotify account.
